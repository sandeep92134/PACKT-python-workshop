        "2. Press Ctrl + D to exit **pypy**. You're going to use the program from Chapter 7, Becoming Pythonic, again, which finds prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes method. There are two changes that you will introduce here: firstly, find prime numbers up to 1,000 to give the program more work to do; secondly, instrument it with Python's **timeit** module so that you can see how long it takes to run. **timeit** runs a Python statement multiple times and records how long it takes. Tell **timeit** to run your Sieve of Eratosthenes 10,000 times (the default is 100,000 times, which takes a very long time). \r\n",
        "3. Create a **eratosthenes.py** file and enter the following code:\r\n",
        "4. Run the file with the regular Python interpreter:\r\n",
        "  \r\n",
        "  The number will be different on your computer, but that's **17.6** seconds to execute the **list(PrimesBelow(1000))** statement 10,000 times, or 1,760 **Âµs** per iteration. Now, run the same program, using **pypy** instead of CPython:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In this exercise, you will have noticed that it only takes 30% of the time to run our code in **pypy** as it took in Python. You really can get a lot of performance boost with very little effort, just by switching to **pypy**."
