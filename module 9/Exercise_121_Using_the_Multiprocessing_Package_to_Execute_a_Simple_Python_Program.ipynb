In comparison, **in_queue** and **out_queue** are both queue objects through which data can be sent between the parent and child processes. Within the following loop, you can see that you add integers to **in_queue** and get the results from **out_queue**. If you look at the preceding **square_mp** function, you can see how the child process will get its values from the **in_queue** object, and pass the result back into the **out_queue** object.\r\n",
