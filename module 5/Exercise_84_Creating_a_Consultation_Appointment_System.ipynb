        "Note that it's not always necessary to use inheritance when building your classes. If you only have one child class, having a parent class is often unnecessary. In fact, your code may be more readable if it's all stored in one class. Sometimes, the job of a good programmer is to consider the future and answer the question, \"Will it become useful at some point to have built this with multiple inherited classes?\" Answering this question simply becomes easier with experience."
