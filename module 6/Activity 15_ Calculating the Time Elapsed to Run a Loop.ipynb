    "You are part of an IT department, and you are asked to inspect an application that outputs random numbers but with a delay. In order to investigate this delayed output, you check the code as there have been updates to the application where the development team has added a new line of code to get a list of random numbers. You are asked to confirm this by checking the time it takes to run that line of code using the time module.\n",
