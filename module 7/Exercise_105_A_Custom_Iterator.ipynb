        "In this exercise, you'll implement a classical-era algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes. To find prime numbers between 2 and an upper bound value, n, first, list all of the numbers in that range. Now, 2 is a prime, so return that. Then, remove 2 from the list, and all multiples of 2, and return the new lowest number (which will be 3). Continue until there are no more numbers left in the collection. Every number that gets returned using this method is a successively higher prime. It works because any number you find in the collection to return did not get removed at an earlier step, so has no lower prime factors other than itself.\r\n",

        "3. Define the __next__() method and the exit condition. If there are no remaining numbers in the collection, then the iteration can stop:\r\n",
        "4. Complete the implementation of __next__() by selecting the lowest number in the collection as the value for **next_prime** and removing any multiples of that number before returning the new prime:   \r\n",
