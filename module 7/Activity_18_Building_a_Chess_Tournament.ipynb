Fixtures are strings of the form \"player 1 versus player 2.\" Because there is a slight advantage to playing as white, you also want to generate the \"player 2 versus player 1\" fixture so that the tournament is fair. But you do not want people playing against themselves, so you should also filter out fixtures such as \"player 1 versus player 1.\"\r\n",
